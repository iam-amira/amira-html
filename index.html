  <h3>A TRIBUTE TO Divine Erhomonsele</h3>
  <h4> A great Guy</h4>
<p>
 <h5>I admire the way you describe things with such clarity, style and attention to detail.</h5> <br>
 <em><h6>Though our friendship would come later, you were a super role model for me in those good days</h6></em>.<hr>
 <i>I often wondered if I would ever be so skilled and respected just like you.</i> 
  <code>All I know is that I’m still playing catch up!</code>
<h6>Whenever I think about you,</h6>
<pre>I also think about the great times we've had in school.</pre>
<small>Fireside Al and The Story of the Little Match Girl (we both love the CBC),</small>
Greece,<u>(our favourite holiday destination)</u> and the fact that you had generously and graciously hosted several <kbd>TGIFs</kbd>when I came back to Lagos over the years
<div>it’s fun to sit on your back deck and catch up with the gang over too much wine and too much food.</div>
<span>What a great person you are and I love everything good about you. </span>
<cite>Would want every moment spent with you a lasting one.</cite>
<font>Greatness is beyond compare.</font>
